Storage of a task must be an atomic query (not distributed across multiple queries) to ensure that it is embedded as one key, and retrieved as one too.

Currently, a query can only be of one type- ability to parse and split into multiple storage+retrieval queries recursively can be added.

Deleting or updating information if it was incorrectly stored by a user prompt, or if it is no longer needed (two more separate branches of 
function calling)

How to determine the number of records to retrieve? (heuristic based on semantic similarity score, upper-bound by LLM context size, can lead
to irrelevant information being retrieved)
